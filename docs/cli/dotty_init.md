## dotty init

Scaffold a new dotfiles repository and set up this machine.

### Synopsis

Create a dotfiles repository from the template embedded in dotty, driven by
a short wizard: where repositories live, which optional tools and coding
agents to include, and how to seed the Brewfile. ghostty, oh-my-posh, vivid,
zsh, and git config are always included.

Nothing is written until a summary is confirmed. init then renders the
repository — including the profile (answers, Brewfile, and the per-profile
renders of anything machine-class-specific) under profiles/<name>, so
profiles travel with the repo and are shared across machines of the same
class — stages it with git (the first commit is left for you to sign), links
the home/ tree into your home directory, activates the profile (the
active-profile symlink is the only machine-local state), and installs the
lobe-icons glyph font. Files already in the way of a link are resolved per
--on-conflict; backups land under $XDG_DATA_HOME/dotty/backups and are
restorable with dotty dotfiles restore.

Re-running init against an existing repository and profile walks the same
interview again with the stored answers as the defaults, so a machine class
can be extended (or trimmed) later; keeping every answer re-renders and
re-links idempotently, and a repository in the legacy layout is migrated to
the current one. Without a terminal the stored answers are taken as-is, so
scripted re-runs never prompt. With --yes a re-run reuses every stored
answer and skips the confirmation summary, asking only which profile to use
plus any question the stored profile predates. A new machine adopts a fresh
clone the same way — run init from inside it, or point --repo at it.
