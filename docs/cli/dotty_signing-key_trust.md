## dotty signing-key trust

Trust plugged-in keys' signatures in the git allowed_signers file.

### Synopsis

Append every signing key on the plugged-in YubiKeys to your OpenSSH
allowed_signers file, so git can verify the commits and tags they sign. Each
entry pairs your committer email (git config user.email) with the key:

  you@example.com sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAA...

The file comes from git's gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile, falling back to
~/.ssh/allowed_signers (dotty then prints the one-liner to point git at it).
~/.ssh (0700) and the file (0600) are created if missing; existing entries are
kept and a key already trusted for your email is left alone, so re-running is
safe. --security-key and --username narrow which stubs are added; --path writes
a different file.
