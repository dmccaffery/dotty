## dotty brewfile add

Add brews to the Brewfile and install them.

### Synopsis

Add one or more entries to the Brewfile, then install the bundle. Entries
default to formulae; pass a type flag for anything else. Entries the Brewfile
already lists (per brew's own parser) are skipped rather than duplicated —
the bundle is still installed. Tap-qualified names (more than one slash) of
formulae and casks, and taps themselves, go through Homebrew's trust gate
first: dotty asks before trusting anything new and records "trusted: true" on
the new Brewfile entry, so the trust survives the trust-store reset that
`dotty brewfile sync` performs.

```
dotty brewfile add [--tap | --cask | --formula | ...] <name> [...] [flags]
```
