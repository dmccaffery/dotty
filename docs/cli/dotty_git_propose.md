## dotty git propose

Open or update trunk-based PRs for the stack.

### Synopsis

Push stack branches and open pull requests against upstream/main
(or origin/main). Default: layers from the trunk through the current branch.
With --all, propose every layer in the stack.

A branch without stack lineage works too: propose adopts it first — as a
discovered chain when the local branch topology makes one obvious, otherwise
as a new single-layer stack. Before any PR opens, every proposed layer must
be up to date with trunk (fast-forwardable) and with the layers below it; if
the stack has diverged or a lower layer gained commits, you are prompted to
rebase + resign, as `dotty git sync` does.

Each PR body includes a stack map with links. For multi-commit layers you pick
which commit supplies the title and description.

With --browse, each proposed PR opens in your browser afterwards; with --copy,
the PR URLs (one per line) land on your clipboard. Make either the default via
git configuration: `git config set dotty.propose.browse true` (and
dotty.propose.copy).

```
dotty git propose [--all] [--browse] [--copy] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  dotty git propose
  dotty git propose --all

      --all      propose every layer in the stack, not only through the current branch
      --browse   open each proposed pull request in the browser
