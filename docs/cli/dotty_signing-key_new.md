## dotty signing-key new

Create a resident SSH signing key on a security key.

### Synopsis

Enroll a new resident, PIN-protected (verify-required, no-touch-required)
SSH key on a YubiKey via ssh-keygen, filing the key-handle stub under the
key's serial in the private data directory.

With several YubiKeys plugged in, dotty asks you to unplug and re-insert the
intended key — the only reliable way to map a serial to a FIDO device, since
YubiKeys expose no USB serial. Esc falls back to a picker; ssh-keygen's own
touch-select then chooses the hardware, so touch the key whose serial dotty
names (it is etched on the key).

Re-enrolling an existing username replaces the resident credential on the
device as well as the stub.
