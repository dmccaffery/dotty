## dotty profile activate

Activate an existing profile.

### Synopsis

Point the active-profile symlink at a profile. Without --name dotty
presents a fuzzy-finding picklist of existing profiles. If the named profile
does not exist, dotty offers to create it first. A freshly activated profile
with no Brewfile gets one dumped from the currently installed brews.

```
dotty profile activate [flags]
```

### Examples

  dotty profile activate --name=work
```

### Options

      --name string   profile to activate
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
