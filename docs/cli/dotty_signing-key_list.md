## dotty signing-key list

List the signing keys on plugged-in security keys.

### Synopsis

Show the signing keys of all currently plugged-in YubiKeys in a
fuzzy-filterable table (serial, aliases, key type, username). Selecting a row
prints its private key stub and public key; esc exits without printing.
Unlike the other signing-key verbs, list never asks you to pick a key first.
Without a terminal the table prints plainly and nothing is selectable.

```
