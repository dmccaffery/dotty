## dotty profile

Manage system profiles that travel across machines.

### Synopsis

Profiles are per-machine configuration sets — a Brewfile today; prompt and
terminal themes later — stored under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dotty/<name> so a public
dotfiles repository can carry them. One profile is active at a time, named by
the active-profile symlink.

### Examples

```
  dotty profile new --name=work --description="work laptop"
  dotty profile activate
  dotty profile activate --name=personal
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for profile
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --profile string   profile to operate on (defaults to the active profile)
```
